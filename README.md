# Luma - Minimal Launcher

![Preview](art/preview.png)

Fork of [OlauncherCF](https://github.com/OlauncherCF/OlauncherCF) inspired by [InkOS](https://github.com/gezimos/inkOS).

This launcher was made for use on the Light Phone III, it may look weird on other devices. I removed as many features as possible and set sensible default settings.

It uses [Public Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Public+Sans) as the font.

Feel free to submit issues, create PRs and fork!

## Installation
You can grab the .apk from [latest release](https://github.com/vandamd/Luma/releases/latest), or you can copy the repo link and use [Obtanium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium).
