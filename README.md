# Luma - Minimal Launcher

![Preview](art/preview.png)

Fork of [OlauncherCF](https://github.com/OlauncherCF/OlauncherCF) inspired by [InkOS](https://github.com/gezimos/inkOS).

This launcher was made for use on the Light Phone III, it may look weird on other devices. I removed as many features as possible and set sensible default settings.

It uses [Public Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Public+Sans) as the font.

Feel free to submit issues, create PRs and fork!

## Installation
You can grab the .apk from [latest release](https://github.com/vandamd/Luma/releases/latest), or you can copy the repo link and use [Obtanium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium).

## Recommended Settings
Luma now pins its typography and layout spacing to the Light Phone sizing, so Android's font or display size sliders no longer affect the launcher. Adjust other display preferences however you'd like, or pick between the built-in font size presets under Settings → Font Size.
